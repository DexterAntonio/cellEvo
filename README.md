<b> Purpose </b> The purpose of this code is to graphically illustrate the results of an evolution program I developed. Two cells evolve at different evolutionary rates and eventually one cell outlives the other. I coded this quickly because I had an idea in my head I wanted to test, and unfortunately it is poorly documented.

<b> Installation </b> Download all the files and run the test file with python3
